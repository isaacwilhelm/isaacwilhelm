<div class="header">Climate Survey</div>
<div class="summary">From 2015 to 2019, I organized a biennial climate survey for the Rutgers philosophy department. The climate survey gauged the atmosphere of the Rutgers philosophy department among graduate students in general, and among graduate students who are members of underrepresented groups in particular. Please feel free to contact me if you would like more information, or if you would like advice on how to set up and run a climate survey in your own department.</div>

<div class="summary">Many disciplines use probability theory, including mathematical statistics, philosophy, and physics.
